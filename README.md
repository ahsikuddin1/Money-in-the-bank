Money in the Bank.

## Project Description

Money in the bank is a monthly expense and savings tracker built in React using Airtable for database connections. The app consists of three fields of data: monthly expenses (bills, miscellanous spending, and stocks). A starting budget of $10,000 will be presented for each month. The web page will allow users to add to monthly expenses and see if how much they saved from the previous months.

## API

The airtables will be used to render the data of monthly expenses on the page.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
- Use clean coding
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to add their own transactions
- Use dynamic Css
- Use both class and functional components

#### PostMVP  

- Add external links for users to see budgeting tips
- Adding links to my linkedin, github.



#### SWOT Analysis

So far I am actually understanding React but I will defintley need to review more. Class components are tricky and most of the time confuse me. However, this project will allow more practice with class components and will strengthen my skillset.
